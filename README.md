# HTML Playground

<img src="https://after-school-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cat.gif" width="200px" align="right" hspace="10"> You know [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com), that really popular blogging platform where people post tons of cat gifs? Wouldn't it be cool to see how that works? In this lab, you'll be filling in your own HTML elements and attributes to modify a Tumblr-like website!

## The format of every HTML site looks like this:

```html
<html>
<head>
  <title></title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

Everything on your page should be surrounded by `<html> </html>` tags. The `<head> </head>` tags enclose information about the page like links to stylesheets and other files you would like to include (more on that later). Anything inside the `<head> </head>` tags **will not** be visible on the actual site. The only thing inside the `<head> </head>` tags that you can see is the `<title> </title>` tags. These tags contain the title of your site. You know the text on a tab in your browser? That's where the title shows up.

Everything you want displayed on your page -- all text, images, and videos -- lives within the `<body> </body>` tags.

When you open this site in the browser, you'll notice the page is fully styled for you. That code to style the page has been written for you in `style.css`. This stylesheet dictates where and in what style the HTML should be displayed. Don't worry about the code in `style.css` quite yet. We'll get to that soon!

### Challenge:

The point of this lab is to be exactly what it's called: A playground! What that means is that this is a place for you to experiment with HTML. Don't worry about making mistakes. We want you to get comfortable making mistakes, being okay making mistakes, and then learning from them.

Take a look at the [Mozilla Developer Network HTML tag documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) for suggestions of tags to play with. Have fun making this site yours, and mess around with different HTML tags.

You will want to fork and clone this lab. Open up `index.html` in your text editor and check out what's going on. Look for the tags you've learned about and try to figure out what they're doing.

It's helpful to have `index.html` open in your browser at the same time. If you need help opening it in the browser, take at look at `How To: Fork and Clone`. Make some changes to the file and see what happens the in your browser by refreshing the page! Remember you won't see the changes in the browser if you haven't saved your changes in your HTML file.

Look for comments (any text that's between `<!--  -->` is a comment, and it won't show up on the page) for hints.
